# Template project for talent sessions

## About

This is a template project to use as a start when creating new sessions/exercises for use in Cygni's Talent program.

A session usually starts with a presentation and may also include excercises to do individiually or in pairs/groups.

A README.md should always be present and contain the following headings:
* Background
* Prerequisites
* Instructions
* Maintainers
